TI-85 Command Centre
====================

This is a program written to transfer stuff to and from the TI-85 calculator,
for those students who couldn't afford TI's official Graphlink hardware and
software.

It was written for Turbo Pascal 6, and for homemade interface hardware
(specifically it was tested with Magnus Hagander's Connect-85 link, details
of which can be found at http://c85.ticalc.org/ ). Details of the protocol
used can be found at https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/1/102.html

As it's a 1995 TP6 vintage, it obviously runs under DOS. Putting up on Github
as I don't really know what else to do with the old code, and I'd rather not
have it lost. So sharing seems to be the best way to go :-)
