STARTUP.TXT
===========

When running 85CC for the firt time, run it with the RESET paramter. This will
create the configuration file 85CC.CFG requiered to run the program. You will
then need to enter the setup menu to alter the initial path and com port as
requiered.


85CC Syntax
-----------
85CC [RESET]

where RESET (optional, without the sqaure brackets) will reet the configuration
to initial values.


Changing drive
--------------
Until I sort out an easier way of changing drive, this is the only way to do 
it. At any prompt where you need to enter a file, enter the drive spec instead,
then hitting F2 will launch you into the directory navigator.


Edit-locking
------------
Sorry no unlock available, so remember to keep an UNLOCKED VERSION somewhere.

Sorry, as far as I know, the graph-link won't work with this software; only 
with the home-made serial link.
